description: "The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today is a novel by Mark Twain and Charles\
  \ Dudley Warner first published in 1873. It satirizes greed and political corruption\
  \ in post-Civil War America in the era now referred to as the Gilded Age. Although\
  \ not one of Twain's best-known works, it has appeared in more than one hundred\
  \ editions since its original publication. Twain and Warner originally had planned\
  \ to issue the novel with illustrations by Thomas Nast. The book is remarkable for\
  \ two reasonsâ€“-it is the only novel Twain wrote with a collaborator, and its title\
  \ very quickly became synonymous with graft, materialism, and corruption in public\
  \ life.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
